# GPSAlarm

The GPSAlarm is a simple tool made in Android Studio 2.2.2. for waking up the user once it comes in radius around the destination. 

Main features include:
* Customisable alarm;
* Setting your destination using the touchscreen OR searchbar;
* Setting up a list of favorite destinations.

GPS Alarm currently supports all Android versions for 4 and up.

Application requires an active GPS uplink, and having a network connection is a plus.

# Planned features

A cleaner UI - at the current iteration, the UI still needs more unification in terms of design.

A notification in the taskbar for clarity.
